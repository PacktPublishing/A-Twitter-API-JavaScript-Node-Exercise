As a web developer, you’ve probably heard a lot about APIs and data retrieval over the last few years. This course will teach you how to set up a local server, connect the Twitter API, and return data to output into your web page. It’s amazing how much information is available on Twitter. Connecting the API is easy and can provide real-world working experience with JSON AJAX and APIs.

Twitter has a HUGE amount of data within each Tweet Object, so getting to know the Twitter API and working with it can provide first-hand experience that can be used in any number of real-world applications. If you can navigate and output data from this API, others will be a snap.

This step-by-step training includes everything you need to set up and develop a mini application. It’s great for beginners and developers of all skill levels. You can then use this as a starting point to explore and extend your skills with the endless possibilities. What are you waiting for? You have nothing to lose, so take the first step and start having some fun with the Twitter API!
